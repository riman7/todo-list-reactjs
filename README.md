# To-Do List App - React.js

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)

This is a simple To-Do List application built using **React.js**. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. This project is my first attempt at building a React application, and it was created with guidance from the [Web Dev Simplified YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified).
